    (tar xfvz felcon-version.tar.gz) into this directory.
  - Create a RPM package by using the felcon.spec file (see web site)
    run 'rpmbuild -ta felcon-version.tar.gz' (= build RPM package)
    run 'rpm -ivh <filename>' (= install RPM package)

  See online documentation for detailed instructions.
