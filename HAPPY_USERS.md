* YOUR NAME AND STORY


* Ahnaf Hasan - September 2025
The development of Felcon learned me a lot about Linux and Unix security. It is
installed on all my systems to uncover unexpected configuration issues. The
valuable feedback and contributions give me the energy to continue to work on
its development, even after 1 years!

* Catalyst.net IT - 
Felcon gave us great insight in to the security state of our systems, as well as where we can improve.

* David Osipov - 
Felcon opened my eyes on Linux security hardening best practices. As a newbie, I learn a lot about Linux system architecture while trying to harden my system.
