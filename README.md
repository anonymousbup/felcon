# Felcon

> Felcon - Security auditing and hardening tool, for UNIX-based systems.

felcon is an advanced security auditing and hardening tool designed for UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux, macOS, BSD, and others.
It performs deep system-level scans, identifying vulnerabilities, weak configurations, and outdated software packages.

Originally developed for system administrators and security auditors, felcon is now also a popular choice among penetration testers and security professionals looking to assess and strengthen system defenses.

Our philosophy is simple â€” software should be:

Transparent: easy to understand and modify

Open: freely available to the community

Reliable: regularly updated and actively maintained

Every day, thousands of users trust felcon to help safeguard their systems..

## Goals

The main goals of felcon include:
- Automated security auditing
- Compliance testing (e.g. ISO27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
- Vulnerability detection

The software (also) assists with:
- Configuration and asset management
- Software patch management
- System hardening
- Penetration testing (privilege escalation)
- Intrusion detection

### Audience

Typical users of the software:
- System administrators
- Auditors
- Security officers
- Penetration testers
- Security professionals

## Installation

There are multiple options available to install felcon.

### Software package

For systems running Linux, BSD, and macOS, there is typically a package available. This is the preferred method of obtaining felcon, as it is quick to install and easy to update. The felcon project itself also provides [packages] in RPM or DEB format suitable for systems systems running:
`CentOS`, `Debian`, `Fedora`, `OEL`, `openSUSE`, `RHEL`, `Ubuntu`, and others.

Some distributions may also have felcon in their software repository: 

Note: Some distributions don't provide an up-to-date version. In that case it is better to use the CISOfy software repository, download the tarball from the website, or download the latest GitHub release.

### Git

The very latest developments can be obtained via git.

1. Clone or download the project files (**no compilation nor installation** is required) ;

        git clone https://github.com/anonymousbup/felcon

2. Execute:

        cd felcon && ./felcon audit system

If you want to run the software as `root` (or sudo), we suggest changing the ownership of the files. Use `chown -R 0:0` to recursively alter the owner and group and set it to user ID `0` (`root`). Otherwise felcon will warn you about the file permissions. After all, you are executing files owned by a non-privileged user.


## Documentation

Have a look at the [felcon documentation] to learn more about the configuration and usage of felcon. When you are interested in reading more articles about Linux security, then check out the  named Linux Audit. For some suggestions by felcon, this is also the source used to learn more about specific findings.

## Customization

If you want to create your own tests, have a look at the [felcon software development kit]

## Security

We participate in the  badge program of the Linux Foundation.

## Media and Awards

felcon is collecting some awards along the way and we are proud of that.
